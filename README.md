How to Install the Extension for Free

Open the Extensions page in your browser.
In the top right corner, enable Developer Mode.
Click "Load Unpacked" and select the unzipped folder of the extension you downloaded from GitHub.
Thatâ€™s it! The extension is now installed and ready to use.

This is a copy of UseRightClick. They charge for it, but I made it so you can use it for free.
